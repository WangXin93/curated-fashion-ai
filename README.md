## Datasets

* [imaterialist-2018](https://vision.cornell.edu/se3/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1906.05750.pdf)

  The iFashion-Attribute dataset includes one million high-quality annotated fashion images. The label space includes 8 groups of 228 fine-grained attributes. The labels are curated by fashion experts. Each image has average 5 individual labels. Models pretrained on iFashion-attribute achieve superior transfer learning performance on fashion related tasks.
